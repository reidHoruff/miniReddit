Currently I do not plan on implementing the concept of 'subreddis' or 'boards'. All posts will simply be posted the a single site wide board.

You will also not be able to submit text-only posts, all posts must contain a link to an internal or external website. I may not implement voting for comments and only for posts. Comments will still be infinately nestable, they will just be displayed in chronological order.
